I'm a software engineering in the Bay Area. My only goal in life is to understand more. My favorite activity is having important conversations with people with different perspectives than my own (preferably over a beer or 4). Divisiveness,  negativity and jargon are a big yikes from me.

### More Information

I'm addicted to twitter, so feel free to give me more content to consume (@tylermzeller or like below).
